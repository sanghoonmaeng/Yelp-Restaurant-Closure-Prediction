# Restaurant Closure Prediction

In this personal project, we will build a model that can predict whether a restaurant will stay open or close based on specific features in Yelp, which is a U.S. company that publishes crowd-sourced reviews about business through its website & the Yelp mobile app. The Yelp academic dataset is available on the website although the dataset has certain limitations. 

The predictions from the model will be mainly useful for the restaurant lenders, such as banks, and the restaurant chain investors. We will start by initially exploring and cleaning up the Yelp dataset to U.S. restaurant businesses only. After that, we can leverage the built in features (like the stars rating and number of reviews) and engineer relevant features that will be helpful for the model. Then, we can proceed to fit a logistic regression model to predict the restaurants that are likely to remain open or to close down eventually.
